# Large Sketch Viewer
This Processing library creates a small screen preview of sketches that are too large to view on your current screen.

I created this library because I was developing a sketch targeted at an HD television screen 1920x1080, but I wanted to be able to run, test and modify my sketch when I only had access to my laptop with a resolution of 1440x900.
